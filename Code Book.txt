This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data. 

Data 
====

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation



run_analysis.R script performs the following steps:
============================================================================  
0. Copy the files X_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt and activity_labels.txt in the same directory (working directory).
1. Read X_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt from the working directory into the data.frames: X.Train, X.Test, Y.Train, Y.Test, S.Train and S.Test respectively
2. Create a new variable "Group" to clasify training and test data.
3. Concatenate the training and test data for each X,Y and S in the data.frames: X,Y and S.
4. Read features.txt into the data.frame features.
5. Select the variable relates with sd or mean.
6. Filter the X data.frame with the selected features.
7. Replace the name of the variable of X with another more clear.
8. Read activity_labels.txt into the data.frame activities.
9. Replace the value of the activities in the data.frame S with the name of the activities.
10. Join the X,Y and S data.frames in the data.frame Data.
11. Write the file "merged clean data.txt" with the data.frame Data.
12. For each Subject and each Activitie we calculate the mean of each variable and construct the data.frame Data2.
13. Write the file "features averages per subject and activiy.txt" with the data.frame Data2.
